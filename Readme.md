# Setup script for a very basic Dockerised server using PHP-FPM and Caddy.

Note this is designed to use SQLite to keep the setup as simple as possible so we can get an MVP up and running as quickly as possible.

Designed to be run on Linux Debian/Ubuntu servers only.

Beware - the install script is rough and will nuke any user data when run.

## 1. Set up the server.

SSH into the server as `root`. Run the following to install Docker, set up a user (`www-user`), download this repository from GitHub and extract the contents:

`curl -fsSL -o setup.sh "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ikmolbo/Simple-PHP-Server/master/setup.sh" && chmod +x setup.sh && sudo bash ./setup.sh`

Keep the password safe.

## 2. Test all is working.

Go to the server's public IP address and check we see PHP Info. If not, check the Docker containers are running:

`sudo -u www-user docker-compose ps`

## 3. Log in as www-user.

If all looks good, now we can use the password set earlier to SFTP or SSH into the `/home/www-data` folder as www-data. 

## 4. Copy PHP code

Copy the website code to `/home/www-user/www/example.com/staging`. `Ã¬ndex.php` should be in the `/www/example.com/staging/public` subfolder.

Probably easiest to ZIP up a Laravel site, and unzip in place. May need to set permissions.

## 5. Update DNS records

Edit ./caddy/Caddyfile to add the hostname of a new site, e.g. `example.com`. For a Laravel site, all we need to do is to add a new line to the Caddyfile: `import laravel-app example.com`. 

If it looks good, point the A records of your domain (e.g. `example.com`) to this IP address.

Also wise to delete the default block in the Caddyfile responding to :80, and the `index.php` file in `/home/www-user/www`.

## 6. Reload Caddy

We then need to reload the Caddy server for the new configuration to take effect.

Use `docker exec [container name] [command]` to execute commands in the relevant container.

Here, `docker exec caddy-container caddy reload --config /etc/caddy/Caddyfile` to reload the Caddyfile after our changes.

`docker exec php-fpm-container composer install` should install any Composer dependencies in the Laravel container.

Opening `staging.example.com` should now show the website uploaded earlier.

## 7. Copy code to production

If all looks good, copy the code to `./www/example.com/production` to access it at `www.example.com`

## 8. Add more sites as required.

New sites can now be added by repeating steps 3-7 above.
